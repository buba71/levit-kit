# levit-kit Social Contract

Version: 0.1  
Status: Foundational  
Scope: Non-negotiable

---

## 1. Purpose

Levit-kit exists to provide a **clean, readable, and predictable starting point** for Antigravity projects.

It does not aim to:
- artificially speed up development,
- replace human judgment,
- or hide the inherent complexity of agentic systems.

Its role is **structural**, not decision-making.

---

## 2. What levit-kit does

Levit-kit:

1. Initializes a clear and stable project structure
2. Provides explicit conventions
3. Creates a framework understandable by both humans and agents
4. Reduces unnecessary variability between projects
5. Facilitates human and agent onboarding

Nothing more.

---

## 3. What levit-kit will never do

Levit-kit will never:

- generate business logic
- make functional decisions
- orchestrate agents
- execute workflows
- infer user intent
- perform automatic optimizations

These refusals are final.

---

## 4. Relationship with AI agents

Agents:

- are guests, never sovereign
- operate under explicit instructions
- work within clearly defined boundaries
- never modify foundations without human validation

Levit-kit is **agent-aware**, not agent-driven.

---

## 5. Relationship with the human user

The user:

- remains responsible for decisions
- understands what is installed
- can modify the project without breaking levit-kit
- is never locked into an imposed workflow

Levit-kit introduces **no hidden dependencies**.

---

## 6. Conventions over configuration

Levit-kit favors:

- a single structure
- few or no options
- explicit, opinionated decisions

Customization is possible **after initialization**, never during.

---

## 7. Project evolution

Levit-kit evolves according to these rules:

- few releases
- explicit changes
- compatibility over novelty
- no feature without structural justification

Any evolution must improve the **readability or stability** of generated projects.

---

## 8. Contributions

Contributions are welcome if they:

- simplify
- clarify
- reduce surface area
- reinforce coherence

Contributions introducing:
- magic
- opaque abstractions
- implicit behaviors

will be rejected, even if they appear useful.

---

## 9. Core principle

> Levit-kit does not aim to save time.  
> It aims to prevent losing time later.
