# levit-kit

Hybrid starter kit for **Antigravity** projects  
(template + CLI + agentic conventions)

---

## Why levit-kit exists

Levit-kit provides a **clean, readable, and predictable starting point** for initiating projects with Google Antigravity.

It does not attempt to automate development, orchestrate agents, or generate business logic.

Its role is simple:  
👉 **install a clear framework in which humans and agents can work properly.**

---

## What levit-kit does

- Initializes a standardized project structure
- Installs explicit conventions
- Facilitates human and agent onboarding
- Reduces unnecessary variability between projects

---

## What levit-kit does not do

- It does not generate business logic
- It makes no functional decisions
- It does not execute or orchestrate agents
- It imposes no workflow
- It introduces no magic

These limits are intentional.

---

## Social Contract

The behavior, boundaries, and evolution of levit-kit are defined in a foundational document:

📄 **[SOCIAL_CONTRACT.md](./SOCIAL_CONTRACT.md)**

👉 All technical decisions, issues, and contributions are evaluated against this contract.

## Nature of the project

Levit-kit is a **hybrid tool**:

- a project **template**
- an initialization **CLI**
- a set of **agentic conventions**

Each component remains deliberately simple and decoupled.

---

## Status

- Phase: foundation
- Stability: being defined
- Target audience: developers working with Antigravity

---

## Contributing

Before contributing, please read the social contract.

Contributions aiming to:
- simplify,
- clarify,
- stabilize

are welcome.

Contributions adding complexity, implicit automation, or decision-making logic will be rejected.

## Guiding principle

> Levit-kit does not make agents smarter.  
> It makes projects more intelligible.
