# Levit-kit – Architecture & Positioning

Levit-kit is an initialization and governance tool for agentic projects.
It intentionally focuses on **project foundations**, not on business logic or AI orchestration.

---

## Core Principle

> Levit-kit initializes the ground.  
> Humans design the intelligence.

The tool is designed to prevent bad early decisions while preserving expert control.

## The 3-Layer Model

### 1. Project Foundation (Generated by levit-kit)

**Purpose**
- Define the project boundaries
- Establish governance and quality rules
- Declare which roles and automations exist

**Artifacts**
- `antigravity.yaml`
- CI/CD configuration
- Documentation scaffolding

**Characteristics**
- Stable
- Low frequency of change
- Tool-generated

---

### 2. Agent Definitions (Manual, Expert-Driven)

**Purpose**
- Define how agents think and act
- Specify responsibilities, stacks, and constraints
- Encode architectural and business rules

**Artifacts**
- `agents.custom.yaml`
- Agent documentation

**Characteristics**
- Highly technical
- Requires domain expertise
- Never generated automatically

---

### 3. Feature & Use-Case Orchestration (Manual, Expert-Driven)

**Purpose**
- Describe concrete agentic workflows
- Define prompts, orchestration steps, and memory usage
- Encode business-specific intelligence

**Artifacts**
- `antigravity_integration.yaml`
- Feature-specific configs

**Characteristics**
- Highly contextual
- Evolves frequently
- Human-designed by nature

---

## What Levit-kit Does NOT Do

Levit-kit deliberately does **not**:
- Generate prompts
- Define business logic
- Orchestrate agent workflows
- Make architectural decisions on behalf of the user

These responsibilities belong to humans.

---

## Design Philosophy

- Prefer **clarity over automation**
- Prefer **explicit decisions over magic**
- Prefer **expert control over abstraction**

Levit-kit is not an agentic IDE.
It is a **foundation and governance tool**.

---

## Why This Matters

This separation:
- prevents over-automation
- avoids false AI promises
- scales from solo freelancers to expert teams
- preserves credibility for AI engineers

## Summary

| Layer | Responsibility | Generated |
|-----|---------------|----------|
| Project Foundation | Governance & structure | ✅ |
| Agent Definitions | Agent behavior | ❌ |
| Feature Orchestration | Business intelligence | ❌ |

Levit-kit owns layer 1.  
Humans own layers 2 and 3.
