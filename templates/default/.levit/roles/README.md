# Project Roles

This directory contains the definitions of human and agent roles within this project.

## Available Roles

- [DevOps](devops.md): Infrastructure, deployment, and operational requirements.
- [QA](qa.md): Quality standards, testing expectations, and validation criteria.
- [Security](security.md): Threat assumptions and security constraints.

## Goal

The goal of defining roles is to **reduce ambiguity**. Each role document should clearly state its boundaries and responsibilities to facilitate collaboration between humans and AI agents.
