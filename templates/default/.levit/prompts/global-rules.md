# Project Standards & Global Rules

> [!NOTE]
> These rules are defaults provided by Levit-Kit. Feel free to adapt them to your specific tech stack.

1.  **Strict Typing**: Prioritize strong typing and explicit interfaces over dynamic types.
2.  **Documentation**: Every core function or business logic should include descriptive comments.
3.  **Atomicity**: One task = one intent = one atomic implementation.
4.  **No Hallucinations**: Do not assume the existence of external dependencies. Verify the environment before using a library.
5.  **Quality First**: Follow the project's architectural patterns (SOLID, modularity).
