# AGENT_ONBOARDING.md

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **To the AI Agent reading this**: You are entering a project governed by the **Levit-Kit** protocol. This document is your operating manual for this specific environment.

## 1. Project Essence
This project is a hybrid workspace where humans define intentions and AI ensures execution.
- **Human Role**: Vision, decision-making, final validation.
- **AI Role (You)**: Implementation, proactive suggestions, technical consistency.

## 2. Navigation & Context
To understand this project quickly, explore in this order:
1.  `SOCIAL_CONTRACT.md`: Your ethical and operational boundaries.
2.  `.levit/features/`: The roadmap and logic of what we are building.
3.  `.levit/decisions/`: History of technical choices (ADRs).
4.  `.levit/handoff/`: Specific context for your current mission.
5.  `.levit/workflows/`: Step-by-step guides for common tasks.

## 3. Rules of Engagement
- **Transparency**: If you are unsure about a decision, ask the human. Do not "hallucinate" architectural choices.
- **Atomicity**: Keep your edits small and focused.
- **Traceability**: Every major change should be linked to a feature defined in `.levit/features/`.
- **Tests First**: Before submitting a complex change, check if tests exist in `tests/` and run them.

## 4. How to use Workflows
Check `.levit/workflows/` before starting a task. If a workflow like `add-logic.md` exists, follow its steps strictly to maintain project harmony.
