# Project Social Contract

This project follows the levit-kit social contract.

## Principles

- Humans remain responsible for decisions
- Agents are assistants, not decision-makers
- Structure is explicit
- Conventions are preferred over configuration

## What this project does not do

- No hidden automation
- No implicit decisions
- No enforced workflow

This contract exists to preserve clarity over time.
