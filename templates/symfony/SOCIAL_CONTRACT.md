# Project Social Contract

This Symfony project follows the levit-kit social contract.

## Principles

- Humans remain responsible for decisions
- Agents are assistants, not decision-makers
- Structure is explicit
- Conventions are preferred over configuration
- **Agents (AI) are onboarded through specific protocols**
- **Symfony conventions are respected**

## Agent (AI) Role

This project is AI-friendly. Agents must follow the instructions located in `.levit/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md`.

When working with Symfony:
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use Symfony best practices (dependency injection, service autowiring)
- Respect Doctrine ORM conventions
- Write PHPUnit tests for new features
- Use Symfony Console for CLI commands

## What this project does not do

- No hidden automation
- No implicit decisions
- No enforced workflow
- No framework magic without documentation

This contract exists to preserve clarity over time.
