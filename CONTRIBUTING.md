# Contributing to levit-kit

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to `levit-kit`!

## The Social Contract

Before anything else, please read the [SOCIAL_CONTRACT.md](./SOCIAL_CONTRACT.md). This document defines the philosophy and non-negotiables of the project. Every contribution must align with these principles.

## What we welcome

We value contributions that:
- **Simplify**: Reduce the number of lines or complex concepts.
- **Clarify**: Improve documentation or make the code more readable.
- **Stabilize**: Fix bugs or improve tests without adding complexity.
- **Formalize**: Better define conventions for humans and agents.

## What we reject

We will generally reject contributions that:
- **Add magic**: Implicit behaviors or hidden automation.
- **Increase complexity**: New features that aren't structurally necessary.
- **Enforce workflows**: We provide a structure, not a way of working.
- **Replace judgment**: Tools that make functional decisions for the user.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Create a branch for your changes.
5. Ensure tests pass: `npm run test`.
6. Submit a Pull Request.

## Development
